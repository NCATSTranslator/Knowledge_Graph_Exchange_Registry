# Knowledge Graph Exchange Registry

The Biomedical Translator Consortium project wish to exchange [KGX formatted Knowledge Graph Files](https://github.com/biolink/kgx/blob/master/data-preparation.md) indexed with agreed upon [Translator Registry metadata](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorArchitecture/blob/master/RegistryMetadata.md).  This KGX tool generated metadata like this [sample file](./SAMPLE_KGE_METADATA_OUTPUT.md) could be the source for most of the metadata.  Another source of inspiration may be the proposed new [TRAPI Knowledge Map endpoint](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI/pull/171/files).

A key component of this goal is projected to be a [Translator Reasoner API ('TRAPI')](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI)-like web service accessing a shared common NCATS-hosted archive of such knowledge graphs hosted on suitable NCATS endorsed cloud computing infrastructure. This project repository will gather the design documentation and implementation details of this proposed web service.
