# Knowledge Graph Exchange Registry

The Biomedical Translator Consortium project wish to exchange [KGX formatted Knowledge Graph Files](https://github.com/biolink/kgx/blob/master/data-preparation.md) indexed with agreed upon [Translator Registry metadata](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/TranslatorArchitecture/blob/master/RegistryMetadata.md).  The KGX tool generates some metadata like this [sample file](./SAMPLE_KGE_METADATA_OUTPUT.md) could be the source for most of the metadata.  Another source of inspiration may be the proposed new [TRAPI Knowledge Map endpoint](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI/pull/171/files).
