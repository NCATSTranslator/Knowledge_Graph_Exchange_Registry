# KGE Data Sharing Use Cases

This document provides a clearing house for KGE Registry "big picture" use cases.

## Use Case 1: Downloadable TRAPI Results

When a client of a TRAPI-wrapped resource (ARA or KP) responds to a query, the resulting Knowledge Graph
could be exported into KGX formatted file that is persisted on an endpoint of the server running the TRAPI implementation.

## Use Case 1.1

Variant of Use Case 1 in which the KGX data file generated as in Use Case 1 but is copied over to, and persisted in, a central Translator KGX file archive.

## Use Case 2: Downloadable TRAPI Results

A Knowledge Graph represented in KGX formatted file is created by an offline data curation activity then persisted as an archive on a designated Translator subproject-specific endpoint.

## Use Case 2.1

Variant of Use Case 2 in which the KGX data file generated as in Use Case 2 but is copied over to, and persisted in, a central Translator KGX file archive.
