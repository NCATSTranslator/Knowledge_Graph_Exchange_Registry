    Although this API is SmartAPI compliant, it will not normally be visible
    in the Translator SmartAPI Registry since it is mainly meant to be
    accessed through Registry indexed KGE File Sets, which will have
    distinct entries in the Registry.

                KGE File Set version, belonging to a specific Knowledge Graph.
                The 'upload_mode' argument specifies the category and/or mode
                as one of 'metadata', 'content_from_local_file' or
                'content_from_url'. If 'metadata' or 'content_from_local_file'
                are indicated, then the 'uploaded_file' parameter should be
                set to the file to be uploaded. If 'upload_mode' is set to
                'content_from_url' then the 'content_url' parameter is taken
                as a REST endpoint of the file to be transferred into the
                Archive (authentication not yet supported - URL should provide
                unauthenticated access).
                The 'content_name' should be set either to the file name of
                the 'metadata' or 'content_from_local_file', or url transfers,
                set by inference or as specified by the caller (especially if
                the 'content_url' doesn't resolve to a definitive file name).
                The specific KGX file content of the current upload file is
                set by the `kgx_file_content' for KGX data files uploaded
                in the 'content_from_local_file' or 'content_from_url' modes
                set by the selected 'nodes' versus 'edges' radio button.

        Set version, belonging to a specific Knowledge Graph. The 'upload_mode' argument
        specifies the category and/or mode as one of 'metadata', 'content_from_local_file'
        or 'content_from_url'. If 'metadata' or 'content_from_local_file' are indicated,
        then the 'uploaded_file' parameter should be set to the file to be uploaded.
        If 'upload_mode' is set to 'content_from_url' then the 'content_url' parameter
        is taken as a REST endpoint of the file to be transferred into the Archive
        (authentication not yet supported - URL should provide unauthenticated access).
        The 'content_name' should be set either to the file name of the 'metadata'
        or 'content_from_local_file', or url transfers, set by inference or as specified
        by the caller (especially if the 'content_url' doesn't resolve to a definitive
        file name). The specific KGX file content of the current upload file is set
        by the `kgx_file_content' for KGX data files uploaded in the 'content_from_local_file'
        or 'content_from_url' modes set by the selected 'nodes' versus 'edges' radio
        button.
