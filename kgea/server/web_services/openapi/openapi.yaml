  title: OpenAPI for the Biomedical Translator Knowledge Graph EXchange Archive. Although
    this API is SmartAPI compliant, it will not normally be visible in the Translator
    SmartAPI Registry since it is mainly meant to be accessed through Registry indexed
    KGE File Sets, which will have distinct entries in the Registry.

  /upload:
    get:
      description: Uploading of (meta-)data files to a specific KGE File Set version,
        belonging to a specific Knowledge Graph. The 'upload_mode' argument specifies
        the upload mode as either 'content_from_local_file' or 'content_from_url'.
        If 'content_from_local_file' is indicated, then a follow-up HTTP POST call
        to the /upload endpoint is expected, with the 'upload token' returned from
        this call and an 'uploaded_file' parameter set to the file to be uploaded.
        If 'upload_mode' is set to 'content_from_url' then the 'content_url' parameter
        is taken as a REST endpoint of the file to be transferred into the Archive
        (http authentication not yet supported, therefore, the URL should provide
        for unauthenticated access). The 'content_name' should be set either to the
        file name of the 'content_from_local_file', or url transfers, set by inference
        or as specified by the caller (especially if the 'content_url' doesn't resolve
        to a definitive file name). The specific KGX file content of the current upload
        file is set by the `kgx_file_content' for KGX data files uploaded in the 'content_from_local_file'
        or 'content_from_url' modes set by the selected 'nodes' versus 'edges' radio
        button.
