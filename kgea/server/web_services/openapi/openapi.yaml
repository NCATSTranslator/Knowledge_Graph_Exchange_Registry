    this API is SmartAPI compliant, it will not normally be visible in the Translator
    SmartAPI Registry since it is mainly meant to be accessed through Registry indexed
    KGE File Sets, which will have distinct entries in the Registry.

                or 'content_from_local_file' are indicated, then the 'uploaded_file'
                parameter should be set to the file to be ploaded. If 'upload_mode'

                access). The 'content_name' should be set either to the file name
                of the 'metadata' or 'content_from_local_file', or url transfers,
                set by inference or as specified by the caller (especially if the

                for KGX data files uploaded in the 'content_from_local_file' or 'content_from_url'
                modes set by the selected 'nodes' versus 'edges' radio button.
