"""
Implement robust KGE File Set upload process:
o  “layered” back end unit tests of each level of S3 upload process
o  Figure out the minimal S3 access policy that suffices for the KGE Archive (not a huge priority this week but…)
o  File set versioning using time stamps
o  Web server optimization (e.g. NGINX / WSGI / web application parameters)
o  Test the system (both manually, by visual inspection of uploads)
Stress test using SRI SemMedDb: https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/semmeddb-biolink-kg
