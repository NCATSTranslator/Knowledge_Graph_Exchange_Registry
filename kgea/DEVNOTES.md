# Developers' Notes

This file complement both the ["Getting Started"](README.md) document which outlines KGE Archive ("Archive") deployment procedures and the [KGE Archive Roadmap](KGE_ARCHIVE_ROADMAP.md) document which outlines the details about the KGE Archive implementation components. Here, we document a few Archive development issues and recommended (required?) responses.

# OpenAPI Server Code Generation

After the initial flurry of Archive development, the OpenAPI 3 dependent web service code will unlikely need to be modified. However, if there is a need to change it, there are some special considerations.

## Non-Python Code Generation Dependencies

The Archive his project, once deployed, exposes OpenAPI 3 web services defined by the [KGE Archive Web Services OpenAPI 3 specification](./api/kgea_api.yaml).  Boilerplate web service code implementation of these services in the project is generated by the [OpenAPI Tools openapi-generator-cli](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) code generator program.

Although the project itself is coded in Python, updating the Python code for the web services requires re-running the code generator, after any revisions to the API specification. This code generator is a Java software program. Thus, such a Java binary (release 8 or better) needs to be installed and available on the OS PATH (might not be on minimal operating systems). For a Debian Linux (e.g. Ubuntu), it may suffice to execute the following installation:

```shell
sudo apt install default-jre
```

If you are working on a Linux server, you may find the [bash launcher script](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/bin/utils/openapi-generator-cli.sh) useful to manage and launch the code generator.  A copy of this script (circa January 2021) is copied into the `scripts` subfolder of this project repository as a convenience. However, in addition to Java 8, the script has a few other dependencies:

1. [Maven dependency management tool](https://maven.apache.org/) (release 3.3.4 or better)
2.  `jq` program 
   
Again, assuming a Debian Linux OS (e.g. Ubuntu) build environment, it may suffice to execute the following installations:

```shell
sudo apt install maven
sudo apt install jq
```

Running the `openapi-generator-cli.sh` the first time downloads the required JAR file to the same directory as the script, thus when the script is rerun again, it performs all the expected operations. For example:

```shell
scripts/openapi-generator-cli.sh
#... lots of output showing the script execution
scripts/openapi-generator-cli.sh version
5.0.0
```

## Validating a modified API

Whenever a change is made to the project OpenAPI yaml file, it is a good idea to validate it against OpenAPI 3 expectations, as follows:

```shell
./scripts/openapi-generator-cli.sh validate -i ./kgea/api/kgea_api.yaml

```

## Generating Code

A custom project script [generate-kge-server.sh](../scripts/generate-kge-server.sh) calls a locally mirrored copy of the [OpenAPI Generator Script](../scripts/openapi-generator-cli.sh). Running the `openapi-generator-cli.sh` the first time downloads the required OpenAPI code generator JAR file to the same directory as the script. 

The output is something like:

```shell
./scripts/generate-kge-server.sh

Project name: kge-archive
Project description: NCATS_Knowledge_Graph_Exchange_Archive_Web_Services

Project source code: ./kgea
Target OpenAPI: ./kgea/api/kgea_api.yaml
Generated server code: ./kgea/server
Target version is: 0.0.1

Continue (yes/no - default 'no'): Yes

... lots of output

```

The code generator creates a basic README file under the [KGEA Server subdirectory](./server/README.md) which provides basic instructions about how to run the resulting server code, either from an OS terminal or within a Docker container.

## Reconnecting the Generator Code to the Project Logic

Rerunning the server code generation basically appears to rewrite most of the contents of the [KGEA Server subdirectory](./server) with a few notable exceptions such as:

- extra files added to the subdirectory by the developer, which are files not generated by the code generator, including files from previous runs which were not required to be generated by a new run (i.e. when specific parts - tags, operation ids, components - of the API were renamed or deleted)
  
- existing test files (under the [server/openapi_server test subdirectory](./server/openapi_server/test)) which were modified by a developer after the original code generation.

- not sure what else (need to review...)

However, the code generation process pretty well overwrites every other file it knows about by name, with fresh code.

This basically means that it is advisable to separate custom handlers to every api controller method in a separate file, then insert delegation calls in the api controller method, perhaps mainly in the `return` statement of the generated method. Namely:

```python
def access(kg_name):  # noqa: E501
    """Get KGE File Sets

     # noqa: E501

    :param kg_name: Name label of KGE File Set whose files are being accessed
    :type kg_name: str

    :rtype: Dict[str, Attribute]
    """
    return 'do some magic!'
```

becomes something like:

```python
from ..kge_handlers import kge_access

def access(kg_name):  # noqa: E501
    """Get KGE File Sets

     # noqa: E501

    :param kg_name: Name label of KGE File Set whose files are being accessed
    :type kg_name: str

    :rtype: Dict[str, Attribute]
    """
    return kge_access(kg_name)
```

where `kge_access` is a handler method defined in the project developer defined Python module `kge_handlers`, assumed to be sitting alongside the generated api code in `provider_controller.py` (under the `openapi_server/controllers` package in the code generated `server` subdirectory of the KGE Archive project).

This code delegation needs to be repaired every time the code generator is run on the `kgea_api.yaml` specification.

In addition, `boto3 >= 1.17.0` may need be added back into the **openapi_server** `requirements.txt` file.

Another curious transformation is that given the vagaries of multipart/form-data in the Connexion library, the following method parameters are reformatted:

In the `openapi_server/controller/upload_controller.py` file, change the `register_file_set(submitter, kg_name)` method signature to `register_file_set(body)`, then set `return register_kge_file_set(body)` as the return statement.
